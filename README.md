# XRPL-Logging
Log XRPL ledger data to a database, it is left to you to add a mysql schema. But the ability for others to view how data can be collected and archived for further processing is made available.

This is the backend to the threexrp.dev site where CEX and DEX data is abstracted from the XRPL. The data then saved from this service is used to query and build out the views.
